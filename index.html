    The world is full of good ideas, and our democracies should be able to take advantage of them
    wherever they come from. We are creating a democratic platform that allows 
    anyone with a web browser to share their ideas and build a vision together.
    We started out writing a party-independent political manifesto, but now the tool
    we've built to run it is available for anyone to use for their own project.

          <em>The OpenPolitics Manifesto</em> is a party-independent political manifesto
          for the UK that anyone can contribute to. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The process is simple, and as open as we can make it. People with ideas can just press
          the suggest button, make their change directly, and get it voted on. 
          If their proposal is accepted, they get to vote on future changes.

          The document has been put in the public
          domain, meaning that any party or candidate could adopt it.
          <a href='https://somethingnew.org.uk'>Something New</a> is a UK party 
          formed specifically to promote the manifesto, but does not exclusively 
          own it.

          The manifesto is run by a software platform called <em>Votebot</em>.
          It provides a friendly user interface for editing, voting, and discussion,
          usable by anyone with a web browser. You can see it in action by looking
          at the current <a href='https://votebot.openpolitics.org.uk'>manifesto 
          proposals</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system is user-friendly, but underneath it uses <a href='https://git-scm.com/'>git</a>
          and <a href='https://github.com/'>GitHub</a> to track changes and proposals (using pull requests).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Votebot code is open source, can be fully deployed using free
          services, and can be easily re-branded. See the repository README for all the details.
